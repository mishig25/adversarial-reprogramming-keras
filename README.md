### Contents:
- `model.py` contains adv reprogramming model and [custom keras layer](https://keras.io/layers/writing-your-own-keras-layers/) for adv reprogramming
- `demo_nb.ipynb` is a Jupyter notebook for demonstrating contents and usage of `model.py`

### Prerequisites:
- Keras 2.2.0
- Tensorflow 1.8.0

### Tested on:
- OS: ubuntu 16.04 LTS
- GPU: single GeForce GTX 1070 

### Acknowledgments
- Code referred to a [TF implementation](https://github.com/a7b23/adversarial-reprogramming).
